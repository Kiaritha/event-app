This application is meant to be an event booking app specifically suited for event planners and event organizers. 
This app was designed with the challenges that event personnel face while trying to keep track of jobs both already done and those of the future.
It uses JavaScript, some html and CSS for proper functioning and useability of the application. 
Tools such as State management are used to keep track of bookings.
I will be using a local storage API for the testing of whether the app \can keep  log of the inputs that are entered.
 I have utilized tools such as useNavigate to make navigation easier and to create a cleaner code. 

 After reviewing new react education materia, I decided to update from React 17 to react 18 and make the necessary changes for it to be compatible with vite.I also deleted Reportwebvitals.jsx as vite does not need this file. Deleted setupTests.js file as it was not in use 
 Edited the scripts part of package.json
