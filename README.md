This application is meant to be an event booking app specifically suited for event planners and event organizers. 
This app was designed with the challenges that event personnel face while trying to keep track of jobs both already done and those of the future.
It uses JavaScript, some html and CSS for proper functioning and useability of the application. 
Tools such as State management are used to keep track of bookings.
I will be using a local storage API for the testing of whether the app \can keep  log of the inputs that are entered.
